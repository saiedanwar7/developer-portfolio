            <p>I am not a perfectionist, but I like to feel that things are done well. More important than that, I feel
                an
                endless need to learn, to improve, to evolve, not only to please the coach and the fans, but also to
                feel
                satisfied with myself.It is my conviction that here are no limits to learning, and that it can never
                stop, no matter what our age.

            <p>You have the ability to live your dreams. But you have to call the shots. Make a plan and take massive
                action.
                The future favors the relentless.
                Don’t just talk about what you want to do. Go out and do it. People love the sound of their dreams and keep talking about them. But only those who work hard ever taste greatness.
